        I'm don't afraid of challenges and tough topics. I'm ambiotious and
        hardworkig. In projects I'm often responsible for creating new solutions
        from scratch. I feel comfortable working in backend (which is my main
        specialization) and frontend. I can cooperate with team and I'm always
        helping others. I'm interested in things that in that moment seems
        fun to me, but above all I like creating things that's why I like
        my job so much ðŸ˜‰
